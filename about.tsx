        <p>In Next.js, creating an About page is straightforward, as Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Each file in the pages directory automatically becomes a route. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating an About page:

1. Create the About Page
In the pages directory of your Next.js project, create a new file called about.js
<br/>
2. Accessing the About Page
Once you’ve created about.js, Next.js automatically creates a route for it. You can access this page by navigating to:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000/about
When you go to this URL, you'll see the content you defined in the about.js file.

3. Adding the About Page Link to the Header

5. Fetching Data on the About Page (Optional)
If you want to fetch some data on the About page (e.g., from an API), you can use Next.js data-fetching methods like getStaticProps or getServerSideProps. Here's an example using getStaticProps:
